# GSSoC'25 Contribution Guidelines 🚀

Thank you for showing interest in this project under **GSSoC'25**!
Please read the following rules carefully to ensure smooth collaboration.

---

## 📌 Issue Assignment

* One issue = one assignee (unless marked `open for all`).
* If there’s **no update within 7 days**, the issue will be unassigned.
* Comment regularly to show you're actively working.

---

## 🎯 Pull Requests

* PRs must be linked to a valid issue.
* Always work on a **new branch** (never push to `main`).
* Use clear commit messages:

  * `feat: add new feature`
  * `fix: resolve bug`
  * `docs: update README`
* Spam or copied code will be marked **invalid**.

---

## 🏆 Points System

Points are awarded based on the issue difficulty:

| Level  | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| Easy   | 4      |
| Medium | 7      |
| Hard   | 10     |

> Labels will be added **1-2 days after assignment** to track activeness.

---

## ✅ Code of Conduct

* Be respectful to all contributors.
* Do not copy or take credit for others’ work.
* Be open to feedback.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

* Write clean, well-commented code.
* Run tests/lint checks (if available) before submitting.
* Keep PRs focused — avoid combining unrelated changes.
