title: Java for-each Loop
description: In this tutorial, we will learn about the Java for-each loop and its difference with for loop with the help of examples.
---

In Java, the **for-each loop** is used to iterate through elements of [arrays](/docs/arrays) and collections (like [ArrayList](/docs/arraylist)). It is also known as the enhanced for loop.

## `for-each` Loop Syntax
The syntax of the Java **for-each** loop is:

```java
for(dataType item : array) {
    ...
}
```
Here,

- **array** - an array or a collection
- **item** - each item of array/collection is assigned to this variable
- **dataType** - the data type of the array/collection

### Example 1: Print Array Elements

#### Input

```java
// print array elements

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create an array
    int[] numbers = {3, 9, 5, -5};

    // for each loop
    for (int number: numbers) {
      System.out.println(number);
    }
  }
}
```
#### Output

```plaintext
3
9
5
-5
```
Here, we have used the **for-each loop** to print each element of the numbers array one by one.

- In the first iteration, the item will be 3.
- In the second iteration, the item will be 9.
- In the third iteration, the item will be 5.
- In the fourth iteration, the item will be -5.

### Example 2: Sum of Array Elements

#### Input

```java
// Calculate the sum of all elements of an array

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {

   // an array of numbers
   int[] numbers = {3, 4, 5, -5, 0, 12};
   int sum = 0;

   // iterating through each element of the array
   for (int number: numbers) {
     sum += number;
   }

   System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
 }
}
```
#### Output:

```plaintext
Sum = 19
```

In the above program, the execution of the for-each loop looks as:

| Iteration |	Variables |
|----------|----------|
|1|	`number` = 3  `sum` = 0 + 3 = 3|
|2|	`number` = 4  `sum` = 3 + 4 = 7
|3|	`number` = 5  `sum` = 7 + 5 = 12|
|4|	`number` = -5  `sum` = 12 + (-5) = 7|
|5|	`number` = 0  `sum` = 7 + 0 = 7|
|6| `number` = 12  `sum` = 7 + 12 = 19|

As we can see, we have added each element of the `numbers` array to the `sum` variable in each iteration of the loop.

## for loop Vs for-each loop

Let's see how a for-each loop is different from a regular [Java for loop](/docs/for-loop).

### 1. Using for loop

#### Input

```java
class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {

   char[] vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};

   // iterating through an array using a for loop
   for (int i = 0; i < vowels.length; ++ i) {
     System.out.println(vowels[i]);
   }
 }
}
```
#### Output:

```plaintext
a
e
i
o
u
```
### 2. Using for-each Loop

#### Input

```java
class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {

   char[] vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};

   // iterating through an array using the for-each loop
   for (char item: vowels) {
     System.out.println(item);
   }
 }
}
```
#### Output:

```plaintext
a
e
i
o
u
```
Here, the output of both programs is the same. However, the **for-each** loop is easier to write and understand.

This is why the **for-each** loop is preferred over the **for** loop when working with arrays and collections.
