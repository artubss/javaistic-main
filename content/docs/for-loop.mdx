title: Java for Loop
description: In this tutorial, we will learn how to use for loop in Java with the help of examples and we will also learn about the working of Loop in computer programming.
---

In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then rather than typing the same code 100 times, you can use a loop.

In Java, there are three types of loops.

- for loop
- while loop
- do...while loop

This tutorial focuses on the for loop. You will learn about the other type of loops in the upcoming tutorials.

## Java for Loop

Java `for` loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. The syntax of `for` loop is:

```java
for (initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression) {
    // body of the loop
}
```

Here,

1. The **initialExpression** initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
2. The **condition** is evaluated. If the **condition** is `true`, the body of the `for` loop is executed.
3. The **updateExpression** updates the value of **initialExpression**.
4. The **condition** is evaluated again. The process continues until the **condition** is `false`.

To learn more about the conditions, visit [Java relational](operators#3-java-relational-operators) and [logical operators](operators#4-java-logical-operators).

### Example 1: Display a Text Five Times

#### Input

```java
// Program to print a text 5 times

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int n = 5;
    // for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      System.out.println("Java is fun");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
Java is fun
Java is fun
Java is fun
Java is fun
Java is fun
```

Here is how this program works.

| Iteration |     Variable     | Condition: i `<=` n |                       Action                        |
| :-------: | :--------------: | :---------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|    1st    | `i = 1`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `Java is fun` is printed `i` is increased to **2**. |
|    2nd    | `i = 2`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `Java is fun` is printed `i` is increased to **3**. |
|    3rd    | `i = 3`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `Java is fun` is printed `i` is increased to **4**. |
|    4th    | `i = 4`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `Java is fun` is printed `i` is increased to **5**. |
|    5th    | `i = 5`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `Java is fun` is printed `i` is increased to **6**. |
|    6th    | `i = 6`, `n = 5` |      `false`      |               The loop is terminated.               |

### Example 2: Display numbers from 1 to 5

#### Input

```java
// Program to print numbers from 1 to 5

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int n = 5;
    // for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
1
2
3
4
5
```

Here is how the program works.

| Iteration |     Variable     | Condition: i `<=` n |                  Action                   |
| :-------: | :--------------: | :---------------: | :---------------------------------------: |
|    1st    | `i = 1`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `1` is printed `i` is increased to **2**. |
|    2nd    | `i = 2`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `2` is printed `i` is increased to **3**. |
|    3rd    | `i = 3`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `3` is printed `i` is increased to **4**. |
|    4th    | `i = 4`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `4` is printed `i` is increased to **5**. |
|    5th    | `i = 5`, `n = 5` |      `true`       | `5` is printed `i` is increased to **6**. |
|    6th    | `i = 6`, `n = 5` |      `false`      |          The loop is terminated.          |

### Example 3: Display Sum of n Natural Numbers

```java
// Program to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 1000.

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int sum = 0;
    int n = 1000;

    // for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      // body inside for loop
      sum += i;     // sum = sum + i
    }

    System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
  }
}
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
Sum = 500500
```

Here, the value of `sum` is **0** initially. Then, the for loop is iterated from `i = 1 to 1000`. In each iteration, `i` is added to `sum`and its value is increased by **1**.

When `i` becomes **1001**, the test condition is `false` and `sum` will be equal to `0 + 1 + 2 + .... + 1000`.

The above program to add the sum of natural numbers can also be written as

```java
// Program to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 1000.

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int sum = 0;
    int n = 1000;

    // for loop
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
      // body inside for loop
      sum += i;     // sum = sum + i
    }

    System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
  }
}
```

The output of this program is the same as the **Example 3**.

## Java for-each Loop

The Java for loop has an alternative syntax that makes it easy to iterate through [arrays](arrays) and collections. For example,

#### Input

```java
// print array elements

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create an array
    int[] numbers = {3, 7, 5, -5};

    // iterating through the array
    for (int number: numbers) {
       System.out.println(number);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
3
7
5
-5
```

Here, we have used the **for-each loop** to print each element of the `numbers` array one by one.

In the first iteration of the loop, `number` will be 3, `number` will be 7 in second iteration and so on.

## Java Infinite for Loop

If we set the test expression in such a way that it never evaluates to false, the for loop will run forever. This is called infinite for loop. For example,

#### Input

```java
// Infinite for Loop

class Infinite {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; --i) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the test expression ,`i <= 10`, is never `false` and Hello is printed repeatedly until the memory runs out.
