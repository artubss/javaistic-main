Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example,`+` is an operator used for addition, while `*` is also an operator used for multiplication.

Operators in Java can be classified into 5 types:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Relational Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Unary Operators
6. Bitwise Operators


## 1. Java Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data. For example,

```java
a + b;
```
Here, the `+` operator is used to add two variables `a` and `b`. Similarly, there are various other arithmetic operators in Java.


|   Operator  | Operation |
| :---------: | :-------: |
| **+** |Addition |
| **-** |Substraction |
| ***** |Multiplication |
| **/** |Division |
| **%** |Modulus Operation (Remainder after division) |


#### Example 1: Arithmetic Operators

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // declare variables
    int a = 12, b = 5;

    // addition operator
    System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));

    // subtraction operator
    System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));

    // multiplication operator
    System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));

    // division operator
    System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));

    // modulo operator
    System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
  }
}
```
#### Output

```plaintext
a + b = 17
a - b = 7
a * b = 60
a / b = 2
a % b = 2
```
In the above example, we have used `+`, `-`, and `*` operators to compute addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations.

### / Division Operator

Note the operation, `a / b` in our program. The `/` operator is the division operator.

If we use the division operator with two integers, then the resulting quotient will also be an integer. And, if one of the operands is a floating-point number, we will get the result will also be in floating-point.

```java
In Java,

(9 / 2) is 4
(9.0 / 2) is 4.5
(9 / 2.0) is 4.5
(9.0 / 2.0) is 4.5
```
### % Modulo Operator

The modulo operator `%` computes the remainder. When `a = 7` is divided by `b = 4`, the remainder is **3**.

**Note**: The `%` operator is mainly used with integers.

## 2. Java Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables. For example,

```java
int age;
age = 5;
```
Here, = is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left. That is, 5 is assigned to the variable age.

Let's see some more assignment operators available in Java.

|Operator |	Example |	Equivalent to |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
| =  |	a = b;  |	a = b; |
| += |	a += b; |	a = a + b; |
| -= |	a -= b; |	a = a - b; |
| *= |	a *= b;	|   a = a * b; |
| /= |	a /= b; |	a = a / b; |
| %= |	a %= b; |	a = a % b; |

#### Example 2: Assignment Operators

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create variables
    int a = 4;
    int var;

    // assign value using =
    var = a;
    System.out.println("var using =: " + var);

    // assign value using =+
    var += a;
    System.out.println("var using +=: " + var);

    // assign value using =*
    var *= a;
    System.out.println("var using *=: " + var);
  }
}
```
Output

```plaintext
var using =: 4
var using +=: 8
var using *=: 32
```

## 3. Java Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to check the relationship between two operands. For example,

```java
// check is a is less than b
a < b;
```
Here, `>` operator is the relational operator. It checks if `a` is less than `b` or not.

It returns either true or false.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :------: | :---------: | :------: |
| == |	Is Equal To	     | 3 == 5 returns false |
| != |	Not Equal To	 | 3 != 5 returns true |
|  `>` |	Greater Than	 |  3 `>` 5 returns false |
|  `<` |  Less Than	     | 3 `<` 5 returns true |
| `>=` |	Greater Than or Equal To |	3 `>=` 5 returns false |
| `<=` |  Less Than or Equal To |	3 `<=` 5 returns true |

#### Example 3: Relational Operators

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create variables
    int a = 7, b = 11;

    // value of a and b
    System.out.println("a is " + a + " and b is " + b);

    // == operator
    System.out.println(a == b);  // false

    // != operator
    System.out.println(a != b);  // true

    // > operator
    System.out.println(a > b);  // false

    // < operator
    System.out.println(a < b);  // true

    // >= operator
    System.out.println(a >= b);  // false

    // <= operator
    System.out.println(a <= b);  // true
  }
}
```

**Note**: Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.

## 4. Java Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. They are used in decision making.

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Operator</th>
      <th>Example</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&&(Logical AND)</td>
      <td>expression1 && expression2 </td>
      <td>true only if both expression1 and expression2 are true </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>||(Logical OR)</td>
      <td>expression1 || expression2</td>
      <td>true if either expression1 or expression2 is</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>!(Logical NOT)</td>
      <td>!expression</td>
      <td>true if expression is false and vice versa</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Example 4: Logical Operators

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // && operator
    System.out.println((5 > 3) && (8 > 5));  // true
    System.out.println((5 > 3) && (8 < 5));  // false

    // || operator
    System.out.println((5 < 3) || (8 > 5));  // true
    System.out.println((5 > 3) || (8 < 5));  // true
    System.out.println((5 < 3) || (8 < 5));  // false

    // ! operator
    System.out.println(!(5 == 3));  // true
    System.out.println(!(5 > 3));  // false
  }
}
```

#### Working of Program

- (5 > 3) && (8 > 5) returns true because both (5 > 3) and (8 > 5) are true.
- (5 > 3) && (8 < 5) returns false because the expression (8 < 5) is false.
- (5 < 3) || (8 > 5) returns true because the expression (8 > 5) is true.
- (5 > 3) && (8 > 5) returns true because the expression (5 > 3) is true.
- (5 > 3) && (8 > 5) returns false because both (5 < 3) and (8 < 5) are false.
- !(5 == 3) returns true because 5 == 3 is false.
- !(5 > 3) returns false because 5 > 3 is true.

## 5. Java Unary Operators
Unary operators are used with only one operand. For example, ++ is a unary operator that increases the value of a variable by 1. That is, ++5 will return 6.

Different types of unary operators are:

| Operator |	Meaning |
| :------: | :------: |
| + |	Unary plus: not necessary to use since numbers are positive without using it |
| - |	Unary minus: inverts the sign of an expression |
| ++| 	Increment operator: increments value by 1 |
|-- |	Decrement operator: decrements value by 1 |
| !	|   Logical complement operator: inverts the value of a boolean |

### Increment and Decrement Operators
Java also provides increment and decrement operators: **++** and **- -** respectively. **++** increases the value of the operand by **1**, while **- -** decrease it by **1**. For example,

```java
int num = 5;

// increase num by 1
++num;
```
Here, the value of `num` gets increased to **6** from its initial value of **5**.

#### Example 5: Increment and Decrement Operators

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // declare variables
    int a = 12, b = 12;
    int result1, result2;

    // original value
    System.out.println("Value of a: " + a);

    // increment operator
    result1 = ++a;
    System.out.println("After increment: " + result1);

    System.out.println("Value of b: " + b);

    // decrement operator
    result2 = --b;
    System.out.println("After decrement: " + result2);
  }
}
```
#### Output

```plaintext
Value of a: 12
After increment: 13
Value of b: 12
After decrement: 11
```
In the above program, we have used the ++ and - - operator as **prefixes (++a, - -b)**. We can also use these operators as **postfix (a++, b++)**.

There is a slight difference when these operators are used as prefix versus when they are used as a postfix.


## 6. Java Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators in Java are used to perform operations on individual bits. For example,

```plaintext
Bitwise complement Operation of 35

35 = 00100011 (In Binary)

~ 00100011
  ________
   11011100  = 220 (In decimal)
```

Here, `~` is a bitwise operator. It inverts the value of each bit (**0** to **1** and **1** to **0**).

The various bitwise operators present in Java are:

| Operator |	Description |
| :------: | :------: |
| ~ |	Bitwise Complement |
| `<<` |	Left Shift |
| >> |	Right Shift |
|>>> |	Unsigned Right Shift |
| &	 |  Bitwise AND |
| ^	 |  Bitwise exclusive OR |

These operators are not generally used in Java. To learn more, visit [Java Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators](/bitwise-and-bit-shift-operators-in-java).

## 7. Other operators
Besides these operators, there are other additional operators in Java.

### Java instanceof Operator
The `instanceof` operator checks whether an object is an instanceof a particular class. For example,

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    String str = "";
    boolean result;

    // checks if str is an instance of
    // the String class
    result = str instanceof String;
    System.out.println("Is str an object of String? " + result);
  }
}
```
Output

```plaintext
Is str an object of String? true
```
Here, str is an instance of the String class. Hence, the instanceof operator returns true. To learn more, visit Java instanceof.

### Java Ternary Operator
The ternary operator (conditional operator) is shorthand for the if-then-else statement. For example,

```java
variable = Expression ? expression1 : expression2
```
Here's how it works.

- If the `Expression` is `true`, `expression1` is assigned to the `variable`.
- If the `Expression` is `false`, `expression2` is assigned to the `variable`.
Let's see an example of a ternary operator.

```java
class Java {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int februaryDays = 29;
    String result;

    // ternary operator
    result = (februaryDays == 28) ? "Not a leap year" : "Leap year";
    System.out.println(result);
  }
}
```
Output
```plaintext
Leap year
```
In the above example, we have used the ternary operator to check if the year is a leap year or not. To learn more, visit the [Java ternary operator](/docs/operators#java-ternary-operator).

Now that you know about Java operators, it's time to know about the order in which operators are evaluated. To learn more, visit [Java Operator Precedence](/java-operator-precedence).
