title: Java final keyword
description: In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Java `final` keyword.
---

In Java, the `final` keyword is used to define constants and can be applied to variables, methods, and classes. Declaring an entity as `final` ensures it is only assigned once, meaning:

- A `final` variable cannot be reassigned.
- A `final` method cannot be overridden.
- A `final` class cannot be subclassed.

## 1. final Variable in Java

A `final` variable cannot have its value changed once it has been assigned. For instance:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create a final variable
    final int AGE = 32;

    // attempt to change the final variable
    AGE = 45;
    System.out.println("Age: " + AGE);
  }
}
```

In this example, the variable `AGE` is marked `final`, meaning its value cannot be changed after its initial assignment. Attempting to reassign it will result in a compilation error:

```plaintext
cannot assign a value to final variable AGE
    AGE = 45;
    ^
```

The `final` keyword is often used to define constants in Java, which are typically named in uppercase letters.

## 2. final Method in Java
A `final` method cannot be overridden by subclasses. For example:

```java
class FinalDemo {
    // define a final method
    public final void display() {
      System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }
}

class Main extends FinalDemo {
  // attempt to override the final method
  public final void display() {
    System.out.println("The final method is overridden.");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main obj = new Main();
    obj.display();
  }
}
```

Here, the `display()` method in the `FinalDemo` class is `final`, so it cannot be overridden in the `Main` class. Attempting to do so will generate a compilation error:

```plaintext title="Compilation Error" icon="<Atom/>"
display() in Main cannot override display() in FinalDemo
  public final void display() {
                    ^
  overridden method is final
```

## 3. final Class in Java
A `final` class cannot be extended by any other class. For example:

```java
// define a final class
final class FinalClass {
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("This is a final method.");
  }
}

// attempt to extend the final class
class Main extends FinalClass {
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("The final method is overridden.");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main obj = new Main();
    obj.display();
  }
}
```

In this example, `FinalClass` is declared `final`, so it cannot be subclassed by `Main`. Attempting to inherit from it will result in a compilation error:

```plaintext
cannot inherit from final FinalClass
class Main extends FinalClass {
                   ^
```
