To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

- [Java Operators](/docs/operators)
- [Java Basic Input and Output](/docs/basic-input-output)
- [Control Flow statement - For-Loop in Java](/docs/for-loop)
## Calculating power of a number
A java program to calculate the power of a number is as follows:

```java
public class power {
    public static  void main(String[] args){
        java.util.Scanner input = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Base Number: ");
        int baseNumber = input.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Power of : ");
        int powerOf = input.nextInt();
        int output = baseNumber;
        for(int i=1;i<powerOf;i++){
            output*=baseNumber;
        }
        System.out.println(baseNumber + " power of " + powerOf + " = " + output );
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
Base Number: 2
Power of : 6
2 power of 6 = 64
```

Here we are taking two input from user and storing in a variable `baseNumber, powerOf`. To calculating the power of a number we initialize the output variable with base number and multiplying the baseNumber in a loop for powerOf-1 times inorder to get final result.
